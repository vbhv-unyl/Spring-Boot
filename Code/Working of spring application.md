Working of first springboot application
Let's see the working of first springboot application.
How to Run the App

You have two options to run the project:

Click the “Run” button (in your editor or provided interface)
Or open the terminal and run:
cd ~/workspace/demo
mvn spring-boot:run
This will launch the application and you'll see “Hello, From Spring Boot!”.

How the Code Works :

The application starts from the main() method in DemoApplication.java.
Spring Boot automatically starts a web server in the background.
While starting, Spring scans the project and finds HelloController.
@GetMapping("/") tells Spring which method should run when a request comes in.
Spring calls the home() method.
The method returns a text message.
Spring sends this text back as the response.
That’s how “Hello, From Spring Boot!” appears in the browser.

Quick Note About Project Setup

Normally, you can go to https://start.spring.io to create a Spring Boot project from scratch.
But for this problem, we’ve already created and given you a basic Spring Boot starter project, which:
Is configured with Spring Web dependency
Has all the folder structure ready
Includes a pre-written controller for you to explore
This is the magic of Spring Boot: easy startup with minimal configuration.
